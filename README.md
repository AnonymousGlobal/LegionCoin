LegionCoin White Paper
----------------------

June 18, 2010 - Mexico

LegionCoin (LGNC) is a currency designed from the blockchain up for Anonymous and by Anons. The Global Collective of Anonymous has often been referred to as behaving like a nation-state. I believe Anonymous is in fact a trans-national state, and we deserve and need our own money. Resistance to Empire is never cheap, and revolutions cost money whether we like it or not. Now the Revolution has its own currency. LegionCoin addresses all the concerns that hacktivist and crypto-anarchists have had regarding the use of other crypto currencies.

Privacy
-------

LegionCoin is the ultimate anonymous crypto currency, with coin-mixing hard-coded into the wallets and 2nd layer network. Sending completely anonymous transactions costs a bit more, but is incredibly easy to do straight from the gui. If you want your transaction transparent, you send your LegionCoin via the mainnet and leave your record in the public blockchain. If you want privacy, simply use the Private Send feature to mix your coins. LegionCoin also has built-in support for Tor and VPN proxy. Combining these two features, the coin mixer and the proxy support - tracking a private LegionCoin transaction is near to impossible. 

Security
--------

The X11 algorithm which is at the heart of LegionCoin Core software is one of the most secure general use crypto coin algorithms ever designed. Using not one, but 11 separate chained scientific cryptography schemes to create the hash makes the LegionCoin blockchain unbreakable for well beyond its intended lifespan. Other coins may fall to quantum computing someday, but if so - LegionCoin will be among the last to be broken. X11 also makes double-spend and 51% attacks nearly impossible. The X11 algorithm is also what implements the on-chain coin mixer mention in the Privacy section.

Decentralization
----------------

LegionCoin is the ultimate in decentralized crypto currency development. The algorithm allows for the creation of PoSe (Proof of Service) Master Nodes that are paid out from the block rewards for keeping the Master Nodes in good order. Master Nodes implement a second network layer that creates many additional useful features for LegionCoin users, but their primary role is coin self-governance. Not only can LegionCoin easily survive without the core developers, but it can also survive with no human administration at all - with the blockchain itself actually contracting for development work and making payouts. Users can submit contract proposals on the blockchain, and then Master Node owners will debate, modify - and vote on them. Payment is made by the blockchain itself directly to the vendor, from a 10% tax on block-rewards - once a proposal is accepted by a supermajority of the Master Node owners. To keep the distribution of Master Nodes both democratic as well as safe, a 1000 LegionCoin refundable deposit is required to activate a Master Node on the network. Anyone with a wallet, and enough coin - can do it.

Economics
---------

There will be a total of 2 million LegionCoin minted in the 28-year lifespan of the LegionCoin blockchain. After that, miners and Master Node owners will be incentivized by transaction fees. LegionCoin will have a strong yet gentle deflationary curve that will keep value store high, while avoiding huge price spikes. Anonymous not only has millions upon millions of participants, but we have hundreds of millions of fans and supporters. Many of these people trust Anonymous more than their own governments - and would easily be convinced to use LegionCoin has one of their primary crypto currencies. And LegionCoin is built to be used as a real-time payment system. While 5 confirmations are still suggested, only one block confirmation is necessary to spend your coins. This is made possible and secure by way of the X11 protocol and the Master Node secondary network. The LegionCoin blockchain is lightning fast, with a block-time target of every five minutes. Most transactions with proper fees can be resolved completely in less than a minute. And if you pay more than suggested for a transaction fee, you can get transaction times down to near-instant. LegionCoin is quite simply a magnificent multi-use crypto currency, and will make a very fine general use money.
